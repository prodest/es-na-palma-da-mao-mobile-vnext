   * the aud claim when this claim is present, then the JWT MUST be rejected. In the general case, the aud value is an array of case-sensitive
   * strings, each containing a StringOrURI value. In the special case when the JWT has one audience, the aud value MAY be a single
   * case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI value. The interpretation of audience values is generally application specific. Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.
